# surveys

The repository contains [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) documents describing surveys with metadata defined in `_quarto.yml`.
We recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) (v2022.07.1+554 or newer will also include Quarto) and opening the contained R project.
Check the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org) for information on working with Quarto documents and alternative tools to RStudio (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) for working with them.
