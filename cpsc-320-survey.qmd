## Preamble

Thank you for taking the time to complete this survey.
As you have discovered, worksheets are an integral part of CPSC 320 and this survey will ask you to reflect on your experience with them throughout the course.
Your responses will help the instructional team better understanding your experiences and consider how they can improve the course in the future
The survey should take about 5--10 minutes to complete.

## Informed consent

The primary use of these survey data is for course improvement and to explore student experiences in CPSC 320.
Your answers will **not be anonymous**.
You will log in with your CWL, the system will use that information to automatically add your name to your survey responses, and we will ask you for your student number.
The only people with access to the non-anonymized response data are Stephan Koenig, Science Education Specialist in the Computer Science department, and Patrice Belleville, Associate Professor of Teaching.
They might use the identifying information to associate your survey responses with your grades in CPSC 320.
A summary of the results without identifying information will be available to your instructors after the end of the term.
The summary will only contain aggregated and anonymous data and will not be tied to any students' identities.
The summary might include statements about how final course grades correlated with responses to some survey questions.
If you have any questions or would like to learn more about this survey, please contact the survey analysts, Stephan Koenig (<stephan.koenig@ubc.ca>) or Patrice Belleville (<patrice@cs.ubc.ca>).

The instructional team may also want to include some of the data for conference presentations and/or publications in the future, but only data from students who consent to their use would be included in this analysis.
The use of your survey responses is entirely voluntary and you may refuse their use for external or internal analysis at any time without jeopardy to your class standing.

Would you be willing to participate in this survey and have your data included in internal and/or external analyses?
