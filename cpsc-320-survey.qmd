title: "CPSC 320 Worksheets survey"
author: "Stephan Koenig and Patrice Belleville"

By completing this survey, you are giving permission to the researchers to use its results as stated below:

1.  This survey is not anomymous, but the only people who will have access to non-anonymized data will be Stephan Koenig and Patrice Belleville.

2.  A summary of the results will be made available to your instructors, and possibly appear in an article that will be submitted to a conference or journal on Computer Science education.

3.  The summary will not include any identifying information, although it may include statements about (for instance) how final course grades correlated with responses to some of the survey questions.

Everyone who answers the survey will get an extra x% on their assignment grade at the end of the course.

> x needs to be determined, and the instructors need to agree

Questions:

> Question 1 and 2 might be redundant if we ask them to login using their CWL.

1.  Name

2.  Student number

> Questions 3 to 5 copied from an earlier survey (2018W) that asked about all of the course activities, not only the worksheets.
> Our SIGCSE 2020 paper concentrated on the tutorial quizzes, and didn't look at the data about worksheets.
> I believe we need to ask these questions here as the answers are likely to be correlated to those of questions 6 to 9.

3.  Please rate your agreement or disagreement with the following statements:

    > To keep the survey to a reasonable length, I would recommend keeping only 3a, 3b and 3f.

6.  On average, what percentage of the time given in class to work in small groups on worksheet questions did you spend doing each of the following?

    c.  Working ahead or waiting for the instructor to go over solutions after you'd completed the part(s) of the worksheet that had been assigned?

        Write down what that something else was here: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7.  If your answer to question 3d was 33% \[figure out right %age\] or higher, please explain why you waited for the instructor to go over solutions without having first completed the part(s) of the worksheet that had been assigned.

    a.  Remain similar for every worksheet?

    b.  Vary wildly from one worksheet to another, or from one part of one worksheet to the next?
